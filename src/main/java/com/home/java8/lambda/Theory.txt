What is a Lambda Expression?
A lambda expression is a short way to write a method.
1. Has no name
2. Is used only once
3. Works with functional interfaces

Lambda Syntax
(parameters) -> { body }

In lambda expressions, return is required only when the body uses curly braces {}.
For single-line expressions without braces, return is implicit.

n -> n * n
n -> { return n * n; }


Note: Write logic directly, without creating a full class or method.

Why Java Introduced Lambda (Problem Before Java 8)

Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
};

Problems:
Too many lines
Extra class
Hard to read

Lambda Way (Java 8)

Runnable r = () -> {
    System.out.println("Hello");
};
